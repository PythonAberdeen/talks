# FizzBuzz TDD Kata

## Description

Here is the `FizzBuzz` kata description, that is a little different than the original one:
```
Write a program that evaluate a number:
- for the multiples of three returns "Fizz" 
- for the multiples of five returns "Buzz".
- for numbers which are multiples of both three and five returns "FizzBuzz".
```
